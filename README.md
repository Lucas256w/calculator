Implemented a JavaScript-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Designed and developed the HTML interface, including buttons for each digit, operator, and an "Equals" key. Developed functions to store and calculate values entered by the user and display the result on the calculator screen. Implemented error handling to display message when dividing by zero and handle unexpected inputs. Incorporated additional functionality such as the ability to input decimal numbers and a backspace button for correcting mistakes. Utilized CSS to improve the visual appearance of the calculator. This project involved critical thinking and problem-solving skills to implement the logic and functionality of the calculator.
